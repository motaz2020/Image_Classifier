# Machine-Vision



: In this project we explored different techniques used in image classification.
Different classifiers should be implemented and used to classify RGB images to different categories. 
Feature extraction: HOG feature can be extracted from image by OpenCV functions. 
Traditional classifier: In this module, KNN, K-means, and SVM classifiers are used to classify the images based on their feature vector. 
(Both KNN and K-means classifier should be implemented from scratch, Scikit-learn library can be used only in SVM classifier)
